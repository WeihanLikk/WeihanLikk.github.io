I am Weihan Li (黎维瀚), a PhD student at [Georgia Tech CSE](https://cse.gatech.edu/). I belong to Prof. [Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home)'s group. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, working with Prof. [Gang Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NWqnXNEAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am open to possible cooperation or visiting opportunities. Further, I am always happy to collaborate with other students. If you are interested, feel free to contact me by [email](weihanli@gatech.edu).

## Research interests

I aim to tackle computational neuroscience problems with machine (deep) learning methods:

- Gaussian Process, Point Process, State Space models, Diffusion models.

## Publications

You can also find my articles on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qW4_NR4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) profile.
