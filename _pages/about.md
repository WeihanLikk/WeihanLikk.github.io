I am Weihan Li (黎维瀚), a PhD student at [Georgia Tech CSE](https://cse.gatech.edu/). I belong to Prof. [Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home)'s group. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, working with Prof. [Gang Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NWqnXNEAAAAJ&hl=en). My resume is [**here**](https://github.com/WeihanLikk/WeihanLikk.github.io/blob/main/files/cv_weihan.pdf).

## Research interests

My research focuses on developing advanced methods for modeling large-scale neural (behavioral) data to address fundamental problems in neuroscience. Additionally, I am interested in the intersection of reinforcement learning and LLMs.

**Methodologies**: State-space models, Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Generative Modeling, Probabilistic Inference

**Applications**: Computational Neuroscience, LLM Alignment, and Reasoning
